Move things from TODO to DONE once they are done.

TODO:
  - store size of the elements in the array, not in the elemnt itself
  - ensure 4 byte alignment
  - sort out the exception/assert mess, make sure it's consistent
  - store bools inside the type block
  - store short integers inside the type block
  - store short string inside the type block

DONE:
  - nothing so far
